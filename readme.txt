Project AirWatcher :

As part of an academic project, we are tasked with designing an application that allows an environmental protection agency to track the air quality in certain territories. The application processes data provided by the agency's sensors and provides statistics that can be accessed by three different groups of users: the agency, individuals with sensors in their homes, and suppliers of "air-cleaners". These users can make requests to access the sensor data, which can be used to display the air quality at a specific location and time or to compare the data from different sensors. Additionally, a point system will be implemented for individuals who are rewarded each time their sensor is accessed through a request.
